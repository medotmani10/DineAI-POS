## 🎯 **Best Practices Summary**

### **✅ Always Do:**
1. **Work on feature branches** - Never commit directly to main
2. **Pull before pushing** - Get latest changes first
3. **Test locally** - Run app and tests before committing
4. **Use descriptive commits** - Explain what and why
5. **Review before merging** - Get team feedback
6. **Keep branches small** - One feature per branch
7. **Document changes** - Update README and CHANGELOG

### **❌ Never Do:**
1. **Commit directly to main** - Use feature branches
2. **Force push to main** - Use proper merge process
3. **Skip testing** - Always test before deploying
4. **Ignore conflicts** - Resolve them properly
5. **Deploy untested code** - Use staging environment
6. **Forget to pull** - Always sync with remote

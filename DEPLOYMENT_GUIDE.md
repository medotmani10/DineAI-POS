# üöÄ DineAI-POS Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to manage deployments for the DineAI-POS system using GitHub Actions and deployment environments.

## üìã **Deployment Environments**

### **1. Development (main branch)**
- **Purpose**: Continuous integration and testing
- **Trigger**: Every push to main branch
- **Actions**: Build, test, analyze code
- **Artifacts**: Generated but not deployed

### **2. Staging (develop branch)**
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Trigger**: Push to develop branch or manual dispatch
- **Actions**: Build, test, deploy to staging server
- **URL**: https://staging.dineai-pos.com

### **3. Production (releases)**
- **Purpose**: Live production deployment
- **Trigger**: GitHub release published or manual dispatch
- **Actions**: Build, test, deploy to production
- **URL**: https://dineai-pos.com

## üîß **GitHub Actions Workflows**

### **Flutter Build & Test**
- **File**: `.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, pull requests
- **Actions**:
  - Setup Flutter environment
  - Install dependencies
  - Analyze code
  - Run tests
  - Build for all platforms (Android, iOS, Web)
  - Upload artifacts

### **Deploy to Staging**
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to develop, manual dispatch
- **Actions**:
  - Build staging version
  - Deploy to staging server
  - Create deployment record
  - Notify team

### **Deploy to Production**
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`
- **Triggers**: GitHub release, manual dispatch
- **Actions**:
  - Build production version
  - Create release artifacts
  - Deploy to production
  - Create deployment record

## üéØ **How to Deploy**

### **Automatic Deployments**

#### **Staging (Automatic)**
```bash
# Push to develop branch
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
# Automatically triggers staging deployment
```

#### **Production (Release-based)**
```bash
# Create and publish a release
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
# Then create GitHub release from tag
```

### **Manual Deployments**

#### **Staging (Manual)**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to Staging" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose environment (staging/testing)
5. Click "Run workflow"

#### **Production (Manual)**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to Production" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter version number
5. Confirm deployment
6. Click "Run workflow"

## üõ°Ô∏è **Environment Protection**

### **Production Environment**
- **Required Reviews**: 2 approving reviews
- **Required Status Checks**: All CI checks must pass
- **Required Environments**: Must deploy to staging first
- **Branch Protection**: Only protected branches can deploy

### **Staging Environment**
- **Required Reviews**: 1 approving review
- **Required Status Checks**: Basic build tests
- **Branch Protection**: Less restrictive for testing

## üì± **Platform-Specific Deployments**

### **Android (APK)**
- Built automatically on every workflow
- Stored as GitHub artifacts
- Can be downloaded and installed manually
- Ready for Google Play Console upload

### **iOS (Simulator Build)**
- Built for testing purposes
- Requires code signing for App Store
- Use Xcode for final builds

### **Web (Firebase Hosting)**
- Built and ready for deployment
- Can be deployed to Firebase, Netlify, or Vercel
- Static files in `build/web/` directory

## üîÑ **Deployment Workflow**

### **1. Development Cycle**
```
Feature Branch ‚Üí Pull Request ‚Üí Main Branch ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production
```

### **2. Release Process**
```
Code Complete ‚Üí Create Release ‚Üí Deploy to Staging ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy to Production
```

### **3. Rollback Process**
```
Issue Detected ‚Üí Revert to Previous Version ‚Üí Deploy Rollback ‚Üí Verify Fix
```

## üìä **Monitoring Deployments**

### **GitHub Deployment Status**
- View all deployments in repository
- Check deployment status and logs
- Monitor environment health

### **Workflow Runs**
- Track all workflow executions
- View build logs and artifacts
- Debug failed deployments

### **Environment Status**
- Monitor environment health
- Check deployment history
- View protection rules

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Build Failures**
- Check Flutter version compatibility
- Verify dependencies in pubspec.yaml
- Review test failures

#### **Deployment Failures**
- Check environment protection rules
- Verify required status checks
- Review deployment logs

#### **Environment Issues**
- Check environment configuration
- Verify protection rules
- Review required reviewers

### **Getting Help**
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Review environment protection rules
3. Contact repository administrators
4. Check deployment documentation

## üîê **Security Best Practices**

### **Secrets Management**
- Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets
- Use environment-specific secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly

### **Access Control**
- Limit production deployment access
- Require multiple approvals
- Use branch protection rules

### **Audit Trail**
- All deployments are logged
- Track who deployed what and when
- Maintain deployment history

## üìà **Continuous Improvement**

### **Metrics to Track**
- Deployment frequency
- Deployment success rate
- Time to deployment
- Rollback frequency

### **Optimization Opportunities**
- Automate more deployment steps
- Reduce manual approvals where safe
- Improve build and test performance
- Add more deployment environments
